* UR-UE revisited . groff_man says ::

   Hyperlink and email macros
       Email addresses are bracketed with .MT/.ME and URL hyperlinks with .UR/.UE.

       These macros are not defined on legacy Unix systems running classic troff.   To
       be  certain your page will be portable to those systems, copy their definitions
       from the an-ext.tmac file of a groff installation.

* input/optionstoo.txt:23: (ERROR/3) Unexpected indentation.
  is what it is ... leave it so.

  TODO the curly brace on start of line hides the line 

* doublespace after end of sentence in manpages ? 

  see https://sourceforge.net/p/docutils/bugs/427/

  Chicago manual of style ... hard to automate.
