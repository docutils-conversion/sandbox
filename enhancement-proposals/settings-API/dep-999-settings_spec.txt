:Replaces: Data structure of SettingsSpec.settings_spec


Abstract
========

Revise the datastructure used to specify Docutils runtime settings.


Motivation
==========

.. Clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to
   address the problem that the proposal solves.

The current settings specification

* uses a data structure of deeply nested tuples and dictinaries,

* is paired with the deprecated "optparse" module.

The new settings specifications should be:

* Easy to write and comprehend.

* Easy to parse into `argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument()` calls.

* Easy to parse into code to handle configuration file settings
  in `docutils.frontend.ConfigParser`.



Rationale
=========

.. Describe why particular design decisions were made.


Specification
=============

.. Describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

.. Describe potential impact and severity on pre-existing code.

A facility function in `docutils.frontend` will convert existing
`SettingsSpec` instances into the new format at runtime.

"Off-label use" will be affected:

* 3rd-party code that parses/modifies current `SettingsSpec` instances
  will have to adapt. (Preferably by using higher level interfaces.)

* Use cases with 3rd-party validators that have side-effects will require
  a manual update.


Security Implications
=====================

.. How could a malicious user take advantage of this new feature?

The means to prevent reading of configuration files and/or command-line
arguments must be kept intact.


How to Teach This
=================

.. How to teach users, new and experienced, how to apply the proposal to their
   work.


Reference Implementation
========================

.. Link to any existing implementation and details about its state, e.g.
   proof-of-concept.

`<cf_parser.py>`_: proof-of-concept, first draft.

Rejected Ideas
==============

.. Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this proposal
   were not ultimately pursued.


Open Issues
===========

.. Any points that are still being decided/discussed.
