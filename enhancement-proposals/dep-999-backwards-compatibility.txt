Abstract
========

.. A short (<~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

This proposal defines the public APIs provided by the Docutils project.


Motivation
==========

.. Clearly explain why the existing specification is inadequate to
   address the problem that the proposal solves.

Docutils has a large user base and is used in production at several
places (Python documentation, Linux kernel documentation, CMake
documentation, readthedocs, ...). OTOH, Docutils has a version number
below 1.0 (widely seen as an indicator of "beta" status of a project) and
is missing a clear policy on version identificator semantics.

The current `Docutils Project Policies`_ section on `version
identifcation`__ concentrates on the formal definition of the version
specificator but leaves open what consists a "major change in the design
or API".

The current `backwards compatibility policy`__ is only a stub referencing
:PEP:`387`.

Clearly defining how we will balance evolution with stability is
important to both users and project developers.

Rationale
=========

.. Describe why particular design decisions were made.

People affected by changes in Docutils include:

.. class:: description

Authors
  writing or maintaining reStructuredText documents.

End-Users
  of Docutils native `front-end tools`_ (optionally with 3rd-party
  drop-in extensions) or alternative tools using Docutils either as a
  library [#3rd-party-tools]_ or via the command line interface
  (build systems, Makefiles, scripts in other languages).

Developers
  authors and maintainers of

  - projects that use Docutils as a library [#3rd-party-tools]_, 
  - drop-in components [#]_,
  - alternative front-end tools,
  - custom stylesheets (CSS style sheets, LaTeX styles, ODT styles),
    or
  - re-implementations of the `reStructuredText specification`_. [#]_

A person may belong to more than one of these catgories.

.. [#3rd-party-tools] like Sphinx_, rsted_, Leo_, Pelican_, ebookmaker_,
   MyST_, readthedocs_, rinohtype_, …
.. [#] for example parsers like pycmark_ or writers like rst2pdf_ or
   rst2beamer_
.. [#] e.g., PanDoc_ or Text-Restructured_ (prest).

Specification
=============

.. Describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.

Docutils public APIs are:

* the `reStructuredText specification`_,

* the document type definition (`Docutils Document Tree`_, docutils.dtd_),
  
* names, arguments and behaviour of the `front-end tools`_,

* the interface to custom stylesheets --
  elements, macros and classes used by writers to represent doctree_ nodes
  in the output format,

* provided output templates [#]_ and style sheets [#]_ (unless marked as
  "provisional"),

  .. [#] template.txt, default.tex, titlepage.tex, xelatex.tex
  .. [#] html4css1.css, minimal.css, docutils.sty (LaTeX), styles.odt

* the core "docutils" Python package API [#]_:
    
  - the `Docutils Publisher`_ interface for programmatic use,
    
  - component interfaces as defined by the base
    ``docutils.reader.Reader``, ``docutils.writer.Writer``, and
    ``docutils.transform.Transform`` classes,
    
  

* behaviour [#]_ and names of all **documented** objects.

  Python objects and variables can explicitly "opt-out" of the public API
  with a docstring noting that the object is provisional_ or internal.

  All undocumented objects should be assumed to be internal.

.. [#] see also the `API Reference Material for Client-Developers`_
.. [#] Cf. the `backwards compatibility rules`_ in :PEP:`387`.


Backwards Compatibility
=======================

.. Describe potential impact and severity on pre-existing code.

Beginning with version 1.0, Docutils will follow the rules of
`Semantic Versioning`_. All incompatible changes to the public APIs
require increasing the major part of the version specifier.
Backwards compatible changes can be done in minor releases.


Security Implications
=====================

If required, critical bug fixes may change the public API without advance
warning.


How to Teach This
=================

.. How to teach users, new and experienced, 
   how to apply the proposal to their work.

* Move the specification_ to the `Docutils Project Policies`_.

* Complete the `api/`_ documentation and keep it up to date.

* Generate "docutils" package API documentation from the docstrings:

  - Fix/enhance/add docstrings to improve the output of `pydoc`_.
    
  - Generate API documentation with Sphinx:
  
    - nicely format rST docstrings
    - include attribute docstrings (ignored by pydoc_).

.. _pydoc: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html


Rejected Ideas
==============

.. Why certain ideas that were brought while discussing this proposal were not
   ultimately pursued.

* Use type annotations as an indication of status in the public API.

  - There is no known precedence for this approach.
  - Type annotations may be helpful also for non-public code.

* Use Calendar Versioning (CalVer).

  - Would be a break from current versioning.
  - Docutils does not have a fixed release schedule.
  - The release date is documented in the HISTORY_ and RELEASE-NOTES_.

* Allow breaking API changes in minor versions after a deprecation period.

  - Breaks the principle of least surprise.

* Enumerate all modules, classes, and functions that form the public API.

* Mark all private objects with a prefix underscore.

  - May needlessly break applications that use "internal" objects by the
    current name.
  - Too much work.


Open Issues
===========

.. Any points that are still being decided/discussed.

* Differentiate between "core API" and "extended API"?

  Cf. the `Docutils Project Policies`_

    When Docutils reaches version 1.0, the major APIs will be considered
    frozen

    The major number [...] may be incremented later if there is a major
    change in the design or API.


* Formalise the wording for docstrings for public/private/provisional
  (ideally this would be a single regex pattern)?

* Declare only objects included in the ``__all__`` attribute of their
  parent objects as public rsp. explicitely list all public objects in 
  ``__all__`` attribute of their parents?
  
  This would hide private objects from `pydoc` help on the parent objects.
